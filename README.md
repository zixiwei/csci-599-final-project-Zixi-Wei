Project Objective

This project tries to add obstacle avoidance and attacker identification functions while realizing UAV formation. UAVs can scan obstacles (including other robots) within a certain range, avoid conflicts in advance, maintain formation as much as possible, select the optimal obstacle avoidance route to minimize the impact of obstacles on formation stability, and realize the identification and defense functions for attackers.
