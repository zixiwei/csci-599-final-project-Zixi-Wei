1) Project Objective
    In nature, the movement of a group of fish or birds is special and beautiful, and has its own unique structural beauty and mathematical beauty. This project is aimed to simulate this kind of sports from the perspective of computer, and to realize the behavior simulation of flocks based on unity. To be more specific, let the flockmates avoid external obstacles, and avoid collisions between the flockmates at the same time. What’s more, speed matching can be performed between individuals within the flockmates. Keep the same speed and direction while keeping the individual close enough.
